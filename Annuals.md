##Yom Kippur
So far I've decided that if I'm in Israel I should fast, and if I'm on vacation abroad I can ignore it.

In Israel it's either fast or bike. Biking ends up to being really boring, it seems I enjoy the rush of having cars around, and it's depressing otherwise. Maybe if it was a group bike trip that's more serious that can be fun. Fasting is meaningful and lots of reading and writing can be done. Other options can be starting a tradition, or copying one, like creating family picture albums and going over the old ones.

Outside Israel it's usually a waste of a day of being abroad.
