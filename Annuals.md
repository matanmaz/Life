#No Fixed Month
##Applying for renewal of status in Misrad Hapnim
It's crucial to look at the document and bring everything it says on there, no skipping. That means going to the City and printing out proof that we payed everything. Need all salaries. There's that page with the list of things.

Letters of rec need to have Teudot Zehut of everyone photocopied.

Also need a note from Orna saying that she's renting the place to us.

##Yom Kippur
So far I've decided that if I'm in Israel I should fast, and if I'm on vacation abroad I can ignore it.

In Israel it's either fast or bike. Biking ends up to being really boring, it seems I enjoy the rush of having cars around, and it's depressing otherwise. Maybe if it was a group bike trip that's more serious that can be fun. Fasting is meaningful and lots of reading and writing can be done. Other options can be starting a tradition, or copying one, like creating family picture albums and going over the old ones.

Outside Israel it's usually a waste of a day of being abroad.
