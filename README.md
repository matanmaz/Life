#Intro
Whenever I sit down to write something, it feels good, but I realize that it's not building up. I either lost that document completely, or I see it but it's not connected to anything.

So what's this? It's another attempt. Here I want to keep up a set of documents, such as future plans, dreams, values, thoughts, goals, questions, etc.

Also I want to include here annual things. These are things that repeat themselves every year and I always forget how to deal with them and learn things all over again.
